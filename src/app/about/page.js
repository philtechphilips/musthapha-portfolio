          In addition to creating and managing systems, I've honed my skills in bridging the divide between engineering, design, and product delivery, ensuring that the interest of all key stakeholders are considered. My passion for my work is immense, as I'm perpetually seeking innovative methods to solve problems. I do this by exploring and experimenting with fresh platforms, trends, and ideas. You'll find that my communication skills are top-notch. I'm an excellent team contributor, and I'm profoundly committed to organizational through the attainment of it’s goals.
          As a personal responsibility to the next generation, I coach kids on how to use program drones - small UAVs and UGVs - using Scratch during the weekends. You might also find me engaging in a game of FIFA or cheering my favorite football club, Chelsea, during the weekend.
